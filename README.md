## Highschool Webpage

This project involved building a set of web pages with information about my High School. The pages should be directed towards four different groups: students, professors, administration, and outside visitors, applying a different style to each of their pages. Additionally, the pages should be responsive. The project's website [can be viewed here](https://emmanuelsdias.github.io/web-app-dev/highschool-webpage/index.html).

### Lessons learned

Throughout the project, I learned the foundations of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as how to structure files in an organized manner. Although I attempted to reuse the header, navigation bar, and footer codes by appending them to external `.html` files and then importing them using scripts, I was not satisfied with the end result (blinking of the header etc. due to the loading time of the scripts). In the end, I chose to duplicate the code throughout all the pages, focusing on providing a better user experience. This project was also a great opportunity to learn about efficiently grouping elements together to target them with CSS and to explore basic ways of implementing responsiveness in a website.
